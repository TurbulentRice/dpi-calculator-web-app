# ppi-calculator-web-app
Web application for converting between resolution, physical dimensions, and pixel dimensions of image mediums. Includes presets for quick calculations!

I needed something to quickly do these calculations while I was scanning film negatives at work. It's helpful for predicting digital image sizes, determining what resolution to scan negatives and documents at, and can also be used to find the pixel density of digital images and imaging sensors.


A practice project for learning Bootstrap CSS and DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript.
