## About

A practice project for learning Bootstrap CSS and DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript. I needed something to quickly do these calculations while scanning film negatives for my job, and made this calculator to help:

1. Predict digital image size based on scanning resolution.
2. Decide what resolution to scan negatives/documents at to achieve a desired pixel count/file size.
3. Determine the native pixel density (ppi) of digital images and imaging sensors, to achieve precise 1:1 reproduction.
